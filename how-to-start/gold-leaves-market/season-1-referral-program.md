# Season 1 Referral Program

As a Reiki's passport holder, you are eligible to refer friends to the platform and earn rewards for their engagement.

## How it works?

Once your invitee has successfully minted their Reiki's Passport through your referral link, the referral relationship will be established between you and your invitee.&#x20;

From then on, every time your invitees collect gold leaves, Reiki will reward you with certain percentage of their collected gold leaves.



**Referral Tiers and Referral Reward Share**

Tier 1 referral: When you directly invite a friend to Reiki, you will be rewarded with 10% of their collected gold leaves every time they earn gold leaves.

Tier 2 referral: If your invitee invites their friends, you will be rewarded with 2% of their friends' collected gold leaves every time they earn gold leaves.

You can invite up to 10 friends, and the first 10 friends who become a Reiki's passport holder through your referral link  will be considered as your tier 1 invitees

Since you can invite up to 10 Tier 1 friends, which means you can invite up to 100 Tier 2 friends. In total, you can invite up to 110 friends.



**Referral Boosts**

To incentivize referrals even further, Reiki also launches a boost mechanism. In our referral program, you can receive a Referral boost, which offers a 1% boost for 0-50 invitees, a 2% boost for 50-100 invitees, and a 5% boost for over 100 invitees.

This boost is a incentive for you who bring in a significant number of referrals andwill enable you to earn rewards at an accelerated pace.

| Number of Invitees | Boost of Gold Leaves  |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 0-50               | 1%                    |
| 50-100             | 2%                    |
| >100               | 5%                    |



**Early Bird Bonus**

If your tier 1 invitee comes from early bird campagin, you will receive 10 gold leaves for each redeemed referral.
