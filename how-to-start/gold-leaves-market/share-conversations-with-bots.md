# Share Conversations with Bots

Welcome to our community of new friends!

We're thrilled to announce that the old "Share Conversation with Lumi" feature has been officially upgraded to "Share Conversations with Bots"!&#x20;

Now, not only can you interact with Lumi,  the Web3 assistant powered by Web3Go Intelligent ML models and the latest GPT model, but everyone has the opportunity to create their own personalized bot and hang out with different bots on Reiki

Discover something fun or uplifting that brightens your day? Share it with your friends and spread the joy! And it's not just about experiencing emotions; you'll also earn gold leaves along the way.

By sharing your conversations with bots, you can earn 4 gold leaves per share, with a maximum of 10 shares per day. To learn how to share, check out the instructions here.&#x20;



Additionally, apart from the daily quota of 30 free interactions with bots, you can complete additional tasks to earn more gold leaves and boost your conversation capacity, resulting in more available interaction time.

Remember, your feedback on bot replies is valuable as it helps the bots learn and improve their responses, making future conversations even better. We appreciate your contribution to the growth of all the bots and their creators. As a proof of our gratitude, we have exciting rewards and surprises planned for you in the near future as you continue your interactions with the bots.

So, don't hesitate! Join us today and hang out with the bots to uncover the surprises and rewards that await you.\
