# Your Talking Power

Your talking power has five levels, each representing a different number of daily free messages you can talk to bot. You can boost your talking power to a higher level by exchanging gold leaves, with the number of gold leaves required varying depending on the level you want to achieve.

Here's a table showing the different levels of your talking power, along with the corresponding number of daily free messages and the cost in gold leaves to reach that level:

| Level | Daily Free Messages | Gold Leaves Required |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0     | 30                  | 0                    |
| 1     | 40                  | 3000                 |
| 2     | 55                  | 4000                 |
| 3     | 75                  | 5000                 |
| 4     | 100                 | 6000                 |
