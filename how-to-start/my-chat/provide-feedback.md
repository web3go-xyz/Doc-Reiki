# Provide feedback

The "Providing Feedback" feature allows you to share your feedback on bot's responses, which helps creators improve the quality of their bots. Here's how you can provide feedback:

1. After receiving a response from bot, look for the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons below the message.
2. If you liked bot's response, click on the thumbs-up icon to indicate your approval.
3. If you did not like bot's response, click on the thumbs-down icon to indicate your disapproval.
