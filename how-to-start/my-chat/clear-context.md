# Clear Context

If you want to start a fresh conversation, resolve any misunderstandings, or use the latest prompt, you can simply hit the "Clear" button to clear the context. This will reset or erase the conversation history and any stored information about your interactions. It's like giving the AI bot a clean slate, so it won't have any memory of the previous conversation.

But don't worry about losing your chat history! We're working on launching a feature that will allow you to access your full chat history soon. So you'll have all your previous conversations right at your fingertips.
