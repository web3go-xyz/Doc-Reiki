# Clear Context

To start a fresh conversation, or resolve misunderstanding, or use the latest prompt, you can try to use the "Clean" button to clear the context.

Clearing context will reset or erase the conversation history and any stored information about the user's interactions. When the context is cleared, the bot essentially starts fresh without any knowledge of the previous conversation.\

But no worry for losing you chat history, we will launch feature about full chat history soon.
