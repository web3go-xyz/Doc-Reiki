# Maximize creative power

We are excited to offer more credits and characters of data to our talented users in the AI and data fields. If you possess exceptional skills and expertise in these domains, this opportunity is tailor-made for you!

Selected users will have the opportunity to unlock additional characters and access enhanced features.

Here are the current limits:

🤖 Create Bot: Each user can create up to 3 bots, whether they are public or private.

🔑 Credit Limit of Integrated Bot: Reiki calculates credits based on the input and output of each bot's deployed channels. Each bot has a credit limit of 200,000 for all conversations across all deployed channels.&#x20;

This means that on all channels, the total credits used by user messages and bot responses combined cannot exceed 200,000. For instance, if you deploy your bot to both a website and a Discord server, they would share the 200,000 credit limit. Normally, each character is counted as one credit in GPT-3.5. Longer inputs and outputs will consume more credits accordingly.&#x20;

🗃️ Dataset: Users can upload a maximum of 800,000 characters per dataset, enabling you to work with substantial data.
