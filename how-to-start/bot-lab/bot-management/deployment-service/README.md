# Deployment Service

### What is Credit?

There are an unlimited number of deployments available for the bot. However, there is a limit on the talking credits, which is set to 200,000. When you deploy the bot on different channels, the total credits across all channels, including REIKI, will be shared and capped at 200,000. Reiki calculates credits based on the input and output of each bot, meaning that longer inputs and outputs will consume more credits accordingly.

Normally, each character is counted as one credit in GPT-3.5. Longer inputs and outputs will consume more credits accordingly. Additionally, the number of credits consumed may vary depending on the specific models you choose.&#x20;

Currently, the credits are renewed every 30 days, starting from the first day of your bot's creation date. This means that each bot may renew on a different date. You'll be able to see your available credit once you enter Bot Lab.\
