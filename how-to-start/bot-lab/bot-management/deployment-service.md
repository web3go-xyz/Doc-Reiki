# Deployment Service

#### What is Credit?

Reiki calculates credits based on the input and output of each bot's deployed channels.  Each bot has a credit limit of 200,000 for all conversations across all deployed channels. However, there is no limit on Reiki's platform. \
\
This means that on all channels, the total credits used by user messages and bot responses combined cannot exceed 200,000. For instance, if you deploy your bot to both a website and a Discord server, they would share the 200,000 credit limit.

Normally, each character is counted as one credit in GPT-3.5. Longer inputs and outputs will consume more credits accordingly. Additionally, the number of credits consumed may vary depending on the specific models you choose.

Currently, the credits are renewed at the start of every calendar month.
