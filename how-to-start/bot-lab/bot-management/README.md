# Bot Management

Under Bot Management, you can effectively oversee and control your bots. You have the ability to configure and customize various aspects of your bots, such as their descriptions and appearances. Whether you want to create new bots, modify existing ones, or fine-tune their behaviors, the Bot Management section provides you with the necessary tools and options to efficiently manage your bots.

On the page, you can view your created bots and their basic information. You can also check the "Used credits" section to see the credits count of your integrated channels.&#x20;

#### What is Credit?

Reiki calculates credits based on the input and output of each bot's deployed channels.  Each bot has a credit limit of 200,000 for all conversations across all deployed channels. However, there is no limit on Reiki's platform. \

This means that on all channels, the total credits used by user messages and bot responses combined cannot exceed 200,000. For instance, if you deploy your bot to both a website and a Discord server, they would share the 200,000 credit limit.

Normally, each character is counted as one credit in GPT-3.5. Longer inputs and outputs will consume more credits accordingly. Additionally, the number of credits consumed may vary depending on the specific models you choose.

Currently, the credits are renewed at the start of every calendar month.

When you first enter this page, it will be blank, prompting you to create your first bot.
