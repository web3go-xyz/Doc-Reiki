# Bot Management

Under Bot Management, you can effectively oversee and control your bots. You have the ability to configure and customize various aspects of your bots, such as their descriptions and appearances. Whether you want to create new bots, modify existing ones, or fine-tune their behaviors, the Bot Management section provides you with the necessary tools and options to efficiently manage your bots.

On the page, you can view your created bots and their basic information. You can also check the "[Used credits](deployment-service.md)" section to see the credits count of your integrated channels.&#x20;

When you first enter this page, it will be blank, prompting you to create your first bot.
