# Problems Reiki Aims to Solve

Reiki has three main objectives.

1. #### **Lowering the Barrier to Creativity**
2. **PoC —— Monetizing Creativity**
3.  #### **AI-Native Digital Asset Rights**



#### **Lowering the Barrier to Creativity**

The digital world can be both a blessing and a curse for creators. It offers unlimited access to tools and platforms but also presents new obstacles that can suppress creativity. High software costs, complicated interfaces, and intense competition often discourage people from expressing their creativity. Reiki aims to tackle these challenges directly.

Imagine a world where you don't need a high-end computer or expensive software subscriptions to bring your creative ideas to life. Envision the freedom to create without worrying about the steep learning curves associated with specialized creative tools. Reiki strives to make this world a reality by providing a user-friendly, yet advanced suite of creative tools that everyone, regardless of skill level or financial capacity, can access.

Reiki doesn't only focus on offering tools; it also aims to create an ecosystem that fosters creativity. By lowering the technical and financial barriers to entry, Reiki allows creators to focus on what truly matters – creating. This fosters an environment where creativity can flourish, free from the constraints typically experienced in the digital creative space.

Reiki aims to minimize the AI creativity barrier by concentrating on:

1. Ease of use: Reiki emphasizes user-friendly interfaces and intuitive design, allowing individuals to bypass steep learning curves associated with specialized creative tools.
2. Support for all skill levels: By catering to both beginners and professionals, Reiki ensures equal opportunities for all creators to showcase their work.
3. Inclusive ecosystem: Reiki creates a diverse and inclusive environment that encourages the sharing and nurturing of creative ideas.
4. Empowerment of individual creators: By providing a level playing field, Reiki allows individual creators to shine and contribute to the world's creative landscape.

As an AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) platform, Reiki allows users to create custom bots swiftly and manage databases efficiently (referring to top AI companies' introductions). By utilizing advanced AI technology and user-friendly interfaces, Reiki simplifies the process of creating custom bots and importing data, making it accessible to a wider range of users. This platform streamlines the creation of bots, allowing individuals to focus on bringing their creative ideas to life without extensive technical knowledge or resources.

This is not just a feature of Reiki; it's a philosophy. It's about leveling the playing field to give everyone, from novices to seasoned professionals, an equal opportunity to contribute their unique creative value to the world. By doing so, Reiki is not only empowering individual creators, but it's enriching the collective creative landscape, making it more diverse, inclusive, and vibrant.

**PoC —— Monetizing Creativity**

In a world increasingly dominated by algorithms and data-driven decisions, the intrinsic value of human creativity often gets overlooked. That's where Reiki's revolutionary concept of PoC, or Proof of Creativity, comes into play. Unlike traditional systems that focus solely on the end product or output, PoC places immense value on the creative process itself. It aims to quantify and monetize the unique creative contributions that individuals bring to the table, effectively turning them into tangible assets.

Imagine a scenario where your creative thoughts, your brainstorming sessions, or even your trial-and-error processes are not just steps towards a final product but are considered valuable assets in themselves. With PoC, each creative endeavor you undertake is like a brushstroke in a larger masterpiece, contributing to your overall creative portfolio. Each of these "brushstrokes" can be quantified, valued, and even monetized, offering a holistic approach to valuing creativity.

PoC disrupts the traditional paradigm that often relegates creativity to a secondary role behind productivity. It recognizes that in an age where AI can replicate many human functions, creativity remains uniquely human. By quantifying this creativity, PoC not only offers a new way to measure value but also provides a safeguard for human ingenuity in an AI-dominated world.

Through PoC, Reiki is pioneering a new economic model that places creativity at its core. It's not just about rewarding creators for their final products but about recognizing and compensating the creative journey itself. In doing so, Reiki is setting the stage for a more equitable, transparent, and human-centric digital economy.

#### **AI-Native Digital Asset Rights**

Whether you're a painter, a writer, or any type of creator, your work is being used to fuel more robust AI systems. This is an unfair exchange where AI benefits at the expense of human creativity.Reiki aims to break this cycle by providing a sanctuary for creators.&#x20;

Reiki offers a platform where your creativity is valued, effectively countering the exploitation by AI. The concept of ownership is undergoing a seismic shift, thanks to blockchain technology and the rise of NFTs. Reiki takes this a step further with its groundbreaking approach to AI-Native Digital Asset Rights. This innovative system allows you to convert your skills, knowledge, and even skill-related data into NFTs, effectively turning them into on-chain assets. This not only establishes your ownership of these intellectual properties but also opens up new avenues for creativity and collaboration.

Imagine a world where your unique skills and knowledge aren't just something you possess but something you can actually "own" in a digital format. With Reiki's modular approach, users can build upon existing knowledge bases, creating new "Lego modules" or even personalized AI Bots. This eliminates the need to "reinvent the wheel," allowing for a more collaborative and efficient creative ecosystem.

By embracing AI-Native Digital Asset Rights, Reiki is setting the stage for a future where human creativity and AI coexist and complement each other, all while ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their contributions.
